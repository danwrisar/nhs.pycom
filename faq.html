    What is Python?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Python is a high-level, open source, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in various fields like web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    Why is Python used in health and care?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Because Python is open source, multi-purpose, has extensive libraries for statistics, data science, healthcare analytics and wider research. It’s also got a vibrant and helpful community meaning it’s easier to get started with an abundance of free training resources. Python is specifically mentioned in the Goldacre Review as one of the open source tools colleagues in Health and Care should be considering using.

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    What is open source?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Open source software like Python, is software which is released under a permissive licence which allows for anyone to freely access, use, modify, and share the source code of the software for any purpose. In practice, this means it is freely available to those in the NHS and beyond, without cost, and has a large user base. While Python itself is open source, you can choose whether (and are strongly encouraged) to release your own code as open source, in line with government policy such as Data Saves Lives, the NHS Service Standard and the Goldacre review.

    Why should you learn Python?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    Learning Python opens doors to a wide range of career opportunities due to its versatility and extensive use in industries like web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing. Its syntax is clear and easy to understand, making it an excellent language for beginners. Python, along with R, is explicitly mentioned in the Goldacre review.
    <li>Associated with govt policy documents such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data">Data Saves Lives</a>, encouraging move towards open source tools.</li>
    <li>Python (or other open source tools), is amongst the first steps to working following <a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/">“RAP” (Reproducible Analytical Pipelines)</a> - which is a standard endorsed by the Goldacre Review, Data Saves Lives and the NHS SDE Policy. This promises faster, more robust, reusable and transparent analytical processes.</li>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    Why was the NHS Python Community founded?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>The NHS Python Community was founded to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing, and skill development among Python enthusiasts within the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. It aims to harness the power of Python to improve healthcare services, perform research, streamline processes, and drive innovation.
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    Who are the Python Community Team?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>The Python Community Team typically comprises volunteers or designated individuals passionate about Python and committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for Python users. In the case of the NHS Python Community, it consists of healthcare professionals, programmers, and enthusiasts dedicated to leveraging Python for healthcare purposes.
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    How can Python be used for data analysis in healthcare?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Python can be used to analyse large datasets, including patient records, clinical trials, and medical imaging data. Libraries like Pandas, PySpark, NumPy, and SciPy allow healthcare professionals to process, analyse, and visualise data to gain insights that can improve patient outcomes. Python can also be used to present data or analysis outputs in dashboards, for example using Streamlit.
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    Is Python suitable for developing medical software or applications?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Yes, Python is suitable for developing medical software, especially for data analysis, automation of processes, and prototyping. However, when developing software for medical use, it’s essential to adhere to medical software standards and regulations such as ISO 13485 and ensure robust testing and validation.
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    Can Python be used for AI and machine learning in healthcare?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Absolutely. Python is a leading language for AI and machine learning. For classic machine learning you can use Scikit-learn, for deep learning (neural networks) there is TensorFlow, Keras, and. PyTorch, Natural Language Processing you can use NLTK and spaCy and for LLMs (e.g. AI chatbots) you can use LangChain - but there are many more than just these!. These tools can be used for predictive modelling, diagnostic tools, personalised medicine, and even developing AI-driven medical devices.
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    How does Python help in improving patient care?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Python can help improve patient care by enabling predictive analytics, automating routine tasks, enhancing decision support systems, and, with the appropriate regulatory approvals, providing personalised treatment recommendations through AI models, ultimately leading to more accurate diagnoses and efficient care. By adopting RAP principles, Python can be used to deliver robust, reproducible analytics and reports that are less prone to copy-paste errors in spreadsheets.
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    What are the data privacy concerns when using Python in healthcare?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Python is a tool, and as with any other tool like R or SPSS, patient data must be protected in line with data protection regulations like GDPR in the UK, and project-specific Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA). Unlike Excel, when sharing Python scripts, the data is not normally included, although care must be taken with notebooks which can contain output of processes which reveal data. Notebook output can be redacted automatically as part of continuous integration and deployment, as demonstrated by the gov.uk Cookiecutter data science template. 
</div>

<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
