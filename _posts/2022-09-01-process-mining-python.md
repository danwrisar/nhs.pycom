## Process Mining in Python

The analytical tools used can be complex for non-analysts and the analysis generated provides oversight rather than relevant actionable insights [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].

Process mining as a proven technique to analyse any process flow, with widespread adoption outside the NHS [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].

Process mining is a technique to analyse and monitor processes. A patient journey can be viewed as a series of process steps e.g. in elective care, patients start their journey from a referral, flowing through a series of processes before completing their journey with a discharge [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].
