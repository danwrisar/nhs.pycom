## NHS Pycom at Confed Expo

At the Confed Expo in Liverpool, the NHS pycom team met up with Qian Huang - Chief Impact Officer & Co-Founder @ Logan Todd & Co. 

## What is Process Mining

The analytical tools used can be complex for non-analysts and the analysis generated provides oversight rather than relevant actionable insights [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].

Process mining as a proven technique to analyse any process flow, with widespread adoption outside the NHS [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].

Process mining is a technique to analyse and monitor processes. By process we mean a collection of discrete activities or events. A patient journey can be viewed as a series of activities or events e.g. in elective care, patients start their journey from a referral, flowing through a series of processes before completing their journey with a discharge [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)]. 

The end goal of process mining is to discover, model, monitor, and optimize the underlying processes [[2](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-process-mining-5f4ce985b7e5)]. This can include:
- Process discovery: analysing event data to identify hidden nodes and bottlenecks in business processes.
- Conformance checking: comparing mined process to the reference model
- Prediction: predicting e.g the state or point of time a future event has/occurs
