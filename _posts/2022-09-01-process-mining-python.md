The NHS Python Community team met up with Qian Huang - Chief Impact Officer & Co-Founder @ [Logan Todd & Co.](https://www.logantod.net/) at the Confed Expo in Liverpool earlier this year to discuss the use of 'process mining', a well proven analytical technique and has seen widespread adoption in industry [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].

## What is Process Mining

Process mining is a technique to analyse and monitor processes. A 'process' can be thought of as a collection of discrete activities or events. The end goal of process mining is to provide actionable operational insights and ultimately help optimise the whole process [[2](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-process-mining-5f4ce985b7e5)]. This can involve identifying hidden nodes and bottlenecks in business processes. Checking the conformance of a process to a reference model or making predictions about the future state of the process [[2](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-process-mining-5f4ce985b7e5)].

### Process Mining in a Healthcare Setting

In a healthcare setting, process mining can be used to analyse patient pathways. For example, in elective care, patients start a pathway with a referral, moving them between different appointments and procedures, before completing their journey with a discharge [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].

Figure 1. show a visualisation of an example patient pathway developed using process mining. Qian and her team have found that once everybody can see the reality of the patient journey it is much easier to collaborate, identify appropriate actions, and deliver real improvement [[1](https://www.logantod.net/resources/accelerate-nhs-recovery-with-process-mining)].
